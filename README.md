# coucou-notify
A publish/subscribe service for events, notifications and anything else

# Overview

Today, email is probably the most common way of publishing events to a specific group of individuals. Sometimes however we may prefer to create an open invitation or provide notifications that are consumable by anyone on the Internet. For such cases we only have social media and custom Web solutions.

This application provides a mechanism for publishing events and notifications that are available to everyone, with options to subscribe, unsubscribe, etc.

## Usecases

1. Publish notable calendar events, such as school term dates. As this typically wouldn't present a recurring pattern, each date is published separately (e.g. Term 1 - start, Term 1 - end, Term 2 - start, etc.). As these events are related they could be published as a single Calendar: School term dates.

2. Publish an open meeting, such as a festival. The addition of a registration option would allow users to subscribe to the event and receive direct emails of any further updates.
